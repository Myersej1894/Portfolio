                <p>I grew up in Chippewa Falls, WI and now go to college in Eau Claire, WI. I live with 3 roommates and my cat named Mushu. I spend most of my time reading, singing, going for morning runs, writing, drinking coffee and hanging out with my friend group. I enjoy fashion and my dream is to move to Italy to pursue writing and modeling or travel the world. I also have a passion for learning new languages and am currently taking ASL because that will aide me in my travels as well.</p>
